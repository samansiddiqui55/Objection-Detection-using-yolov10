# üöÄ Object Detection using YOLOv10

This project demonstrates object detection using the **YOLOv10** (You Only Look Once version 10) architecture ‚Äî one of the most advanced and efficient object detection models available today.

> **Note:** The YOLOv10 model used in this project is sourced from the official YOLOv10 implementation provided by [YOLOv10 GitHub repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov10).

## üìå Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv10
- High accuracy and speed
- Easy to run and customize for different datasets

---

## üß† Model Info

YOLOv10 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that brings improvements in:
- Speed (FPS)
- Detection accuracy (mAP)
- Efficiency in parameter usage

This project utilizes the pretrained YOLOv10 weights for general object detection on images or video streams.
